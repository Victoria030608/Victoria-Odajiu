    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p> Hello, my name is Victoria Odajiu. I am deeply passionate about the arts, colours, and creativity.I find great joy in exploring music from different cultures, particularly in Russian, 
        Romanian, and English, as each language brings its own emotional and cultural depth. However, I am intellectually curious and often drawn to true crime and murder documentaries, which 
        offer insight into complex aspects of human nature and social dynamics. Simultaneously, I prefer watching anime. 
        
        As a medium that has sparked my growing interest in Japanese culture and traditions. Through these interests,i continuously seek to broaden my perspective on the world and deepen my creative
        and cultural understanding. Being a current student in the Designing Digitally course, I am motivated to a reconnect with the creative side of my self that I have often kept hidden. Through 
        this journey,I hope to explore weather this path resonates with me or not.As well this will offers a meaningful experience.Parallel to that, I remain open to different professional direction 
        in the future. Although,I am committed to give this opportunity a fair chance embracing what life has to offer me. Rather than closing doors permanently for me.
    </p>   
    
    <p> I am genuinely delighted to meet new people, learn about their interest and form meaningful connections .I find joy in building friendships and engaging in collaborative environments,
        where ideas and perspectives are shared. Working as part of a team, allows me to grow both personally and academically, and believing that mutual support and mmunication are essential 
        for succes in any project. Through this course, I hope not only to enhance my digital and creative skills, but also to connect with others who share similar passions. Being ready to open new experiences, challenges 
        and opportunities for growth. Weather throught teamwork or individual exploration. I am eager to learn, discover my potential, and remain receptive to the paths life may offer me.
    </p>
